Tends to have more boilerplate, but as a result is often more explicit.

For example, only a few properties are consistently bound to a `Backbone.View` on instantiation, and the rest must be explicitly bound in a constructor.

Marionette does cut away some repetitive boilerplate compared with Backbone, and there are some additional opportunities such as [Behaviors](http://marionettejs.com/docs/v2.4.5/marionette.behaviors.html).

While Marionette brings some opinions and structure to Backbone, overall it still is more of a library than a framework. This means we would have to be diligent about sticking to certain best practices and patterns. It also potentially affords the opportunity to build customizations.
