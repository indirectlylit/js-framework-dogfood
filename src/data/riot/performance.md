Riot seems to have good performance, but it's unknown whether it scales. (According to [one source](https://vuejs.org/guide/comparison.html#Riot), performance is comparable to Angular 1.)

It does not seem to support fine-grained optimizations the way that React and BB+Mn do, and instead handles all update logic internally.
