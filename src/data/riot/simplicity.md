Riot uses a very simple and elegant nested tag structure and syntax that feels very familiar to basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It provides the bare essentials and leaves the rest up to the developer.

In order to achieve this simplicity, it sometimes resorts to somewhat inconsistent behaviors, and it has some serious [edge case bugs](https://github.com/riot/riot/issues/1020) in its implementation.

It's a superb framework for its size, but may not be able to handle a larger-scale application.
