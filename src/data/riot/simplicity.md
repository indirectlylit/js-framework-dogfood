It's nice that behavior, html, and styles are presented in one self-contained unit.
Of the frameworks I reviewed it's the simplest to use and also reason about.
One potential cost is that if we want to do something "against" the framework
it will not be so easy.

Riot is firmly a framework, while Backbone+Marionette in contrast is closer the 
library end of the spectrum.
