Angular 2 caused us some initial difficulties in setup and integration into Kolibri.

That said, we've heard very good things from the community about it and we're told it's much simpler than Backbone. The demo app built by Kurund showed that Angular has a simple, elegant syntax.

It uses TypeScript, which is potentially a big plus because of syntax and type checking.
