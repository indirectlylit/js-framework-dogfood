Perhaps just hearsay, but React is considered to have a somewhat steep learning curve.

However, one of React's big distinctions is that HTML is [inserted into javascript](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html), rather than the way most templating languages worked where logic is inserted into the HTML. [It can be argued](https://medium.com/@housecor/react-s-jsx-the-other-side-of-the-coin-2ace7ab62b98#.elkiq0d1j) that this is an inherently more powerful paradigm, though it makes for arguably less easy-to-read HTML.
